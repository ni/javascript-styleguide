**Describe the issue**
We encourage you to file an issue if you're not happy with the way a rule is behaving. Please include relevant information like:
- the name of the rule and a link to its docs
- a code snippet that would be impacted by the rule change (before and after)
- a link to code that would be impacted or projects that have already adopted different configuration

We also welcome issues for general discussion, bug reports, or feature requests.
